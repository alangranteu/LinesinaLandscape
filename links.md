# Links (or what we used to call a blogroll..)

These are a few of the blogs and websites that have in some way influenced me in recent years.

## Málaga and Spain
- [Daniel Capilla](https://dcapillae.wordpress.com/ "Daniel Capilla's Blog") is a prolific contributor to OpenStreetMap in Málaga (see below for more on OpenStreetMap). I especially like his [Map of Monuments and Public Art in Málaga](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/es/map/monumentos-conmemorativos-y-arte-publico-de-malaga_855088 "Map of Monuments and Public Art in Málaga"), both as a guide to discovering the city and as an example of what can be done with OpenStreetMap data and the uMap tool.
- [Las Rutas de Sendericu](https://sendericu.blogspot.com/ "Las Rutas de Sendericu") is a blog about hiking, mainly in Málaga province.
- [El Perro Negro](https://elperronegro.com) 
- [Chris Wright Photography](https://chriswright.photography/)

## Ireland
- [Tough Soles](https://toughsoles.ie/ "Tough Soles") describes the epic hiking adventures of Ellie and Carl, covering all the National Waymarked Trail of Ireland and much more.
- [Wild Irish Walks](https://wildirishwalks.ie/)
- [Hikelines](https://www.hikelines.com/)
- [Our Little Hiker](https://www.ourlittlehiker.com/) 

## Trains
- [Jon Worth](https://jonworth.eu/ "Jon Worth - independent railway commentator") writes extensively on European Rail Travel, especially the less-than-stellar state of cross border connections.
- [The Main in Seat Sixty-One](https://www.seat61.com/)
- [Tube Mapper](https://tubemapper.com/ "Tube Mapper - Photography around London Underground") is one photographer's project documenting the London Underground. I have tried to take this as inspiration, especially when photographing unspectacular stations in the Málaga suburbs.  
- Every Sydney Station (add link)
- [Geotren](https://www.geotren.es/blog/) 

## Miscellaneous
