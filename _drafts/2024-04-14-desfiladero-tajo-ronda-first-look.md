# A first look at Ronda's Desfiladero del Tajo walkway

Last week I read newspaper reports about a new tourist attraction opening in Ronda: a walkway through part of the Tajo gorge that cuts through the city. Access to the walk follows a similar model to the Caminito del Rey, also in Malaga province. There is a fee to enter, and reservations are required to secure entry during a specific time slot. I was able to buy a ticket for Saturday, the first day the walk was open to the general public. 






For more information and ticket purchases, see the [official Desfiladero del Tajo website](https://desfiladerodeltajo.info/).
